Employee Turnover Prediction â€” Google Advanced Data Analytics Capstone
This project analyzes employee survey data from Salifort Motors to predict workforce turnover and uncover the key drivers of attrition. The goal is to help leadership develop data-driven strategies to improve retention, reduce recruitment costs, and strengthen employee satisfaction.

Key highlights:

Data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and visualization of turnover patterns.

Built and compared Logistic Regression and XGBoost models.

Logistic Regression served as a baseline model (high recall, interpretable).

XGBoost achieved outstanding performance (Accuracy: 97.5%, Precision: 91%, Recall: 94%, ROC AUC: 0.98).

Identified drivers of turnover: workload intensity, tenure stagnation, and salary band differences.

Produced an executive summary and business recommendations for HR interventions.

Tools & Libraries:
Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, xgboost, reportlab)
